=== h264 parser ===
This project is attempting to write an h264 parse in python. It is currently
in a state of flux. Eventually, as it stabilizes, individual commits to master
will have the guarantee of working. At the moment, no such guarantees are present.

Currently, this project relies on flvlib to parse the flv tags. Eventually, I''ll do that
parsing myself.

The main goal of this project is for me to better understand the h264 standard; and 
ultimately write my own decoder.
